# Hi there!!

Welcome to my repository, a place where you'll (may) find some interesting (or useless) stuff and personal projects.

## About me.

Have knowledge of jQuery, Angular, Telegram API and Bots, and also like learning Cybersecurity and Pentesting

I don't know what else to say, when it comes I'll update this readme.

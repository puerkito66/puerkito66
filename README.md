# Hi there!!

Welcome to my repository, a place where you'll (may) find some interesting (or useless) stuff and personal projects.

## About me.
I'm @puerkito66, a mexican Software Engineer. I mainly work with Python and Django as my main framework, but also use sometimes Flask, and learning some other frameworks.
I have experience in web develpment with Django, Flask, jQuery, Angular, Telegram API and Bots, and also learning Cybersecurity and improving topics like reverse engineering and binary exploitation

I don't know what else to say, when it comes I'll update this readme.
